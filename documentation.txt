1. In this repo i have implemented three function in js asynchronous programming.
2.First method is callbacks where we use callback to make api call and delay the response by 5 sec after clicking the button.
3.In similar way promises are also implementated but in addition to that added error handling like if promise take more than 5 sec to fulfill then it reject with operation time out.
4.and finally implement async-await and handled error by try caatch block.
